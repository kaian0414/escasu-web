# escasu-web
Coding for ESCA Student Union website. Because of the class suspended period, schoolmates who are not in Macao may not register the ESCASU activities via Google forms, I create the simple forms for registration. I create a simple homepage for self management but one of our member put the VERY VERY VERY SIMPLE homepage link publicly, it is really a POOR page! Therefore, I referenced online template and create a homepage for that link.

## Information of ESCASU
The following links are available on 19-Oct-2021 but I cannot guarantee if they are still available in the future.

In 2020/2021, ESCASU also got a page of introduction from MPISU website. The page was not designed by ESCASU but some related information is included.
